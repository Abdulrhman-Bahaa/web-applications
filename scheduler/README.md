# Scheduler Web Application

I was developing this web app long ago using the LAMP stack without any framework in front-end or back-end (some Bootstrap elements are used like tables)when I started learning to code (CS50x), so I uploaded it to github to start improving it.

The Scheduler Web Application is a lightweight and responsive tool designed to help users manage their schedules efficiently. It features a clean UI, interactive elements, and customizable styles, with cookies and database features.
